El público mexicano es muy especial. Siempre armamos una fiesta increíble juntos. Tengo muchas ganas de volver, de rockear y rodar con todos ustedes, así como de mi primera visita a Monterrey\". -Paul McCartney, junio de 2024. Indiscutiblemente, Paul McCartney es uno de los cantautores e intérpretes más exitosos de todos los tiempos, además de estar detrás del catálogo más querido de la música. Con canciones \"Hey Jude\", \"Live and Let Die\", \"Band on the Run\", \"Let It Be\" y muchísimas más, la experiencia en vivo de Paul McCartney es todo lo que cualquier amante de la música podría desear de un espectáculo de rock: horas reviviendo los grandes momentos de los últimos 60 años de música; decenas de canciones de su carrera solista, con Wings y, por supuesto, de The Beatles, que han conformado la banda sonora de nuestras vidas.",
